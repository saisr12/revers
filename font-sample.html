		<p class="lede">A Grocery Store Garlic Obsession</p>
		<p class="copy">
		At first you might think that Professor Patterson was kidding. A little
		commentary about garlic mentioned here. A little anecdote in passing
		there. Upon reflection, however, it would become clear that the mentions
		belied a deep set obsession with the odiforous bulb.  Making many
		question whether there was vampire trauma in his past.
		</p>
		<p class="other">
		It was an obsession that would eventually lead to his demise.
